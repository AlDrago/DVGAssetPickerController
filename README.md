This is an attempt to reimplement Apple's UI from Messages.app for iOS where
you can select photos from Camera Roll to attach to your imessage.

We successfully use this component in our own [Together video editing app](https://2gzr.com) for iOS where users could import photos using this component into video compilations. Here is how DVGAssetPickerController looks in action:
